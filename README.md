# HuddleLanding Challenge
A landing page challenge from frontendmentor.

## Design Features:

- Curved Sections Design
- Optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- Hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
I didnt got acess to figma file so i used just the png screenshot. (you can see the design image at the end of the page)

Users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Considerations:
- I've changed the background color to a slight darker white so it could be easier to see the curved sections desnign.
- This is the first challenge i worked on and it was great to improve my HTML & CSS skills.
- Now i have a better logic to write more codes based in those languages;
- I still have a lot of practice and work to do before master those languages, but i'm enjoying very much to create content with them;
- I didn't got acess to figma's design, only the design .jpg, so it isn't 100% like the model page, but i think i did a good job.
- Since i used just HTML & CSS here, i'll do a **deep** dive in JS, to learn more about the leanguage and implement in my projects.

## Updates: 
13/07 : Curved sections now swich to mobile version image with the JS code that i've implemeted.
